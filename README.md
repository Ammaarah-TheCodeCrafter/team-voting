# Voting repo

Repo for vac-week 2025 voting via git

## Phase 1

On an up to date new branch, each team needs to create a json file with their group number that follows the `group-template.json` sample.

Name the file `group-??.json` where the `??` is your group number, e.g. `group-05.json`.

Create a merge request for your team's details.

Once enough people have approved the PR, Rudolph will merge it.

## Phase 2

This phase will be anounced tomorrow and will require each group member to make a PR, so make sure you and your team-mates know how to make a commit and make a PR.
